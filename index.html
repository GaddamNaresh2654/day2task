               <p><h3>AYODHYA TEMPLE</h3>Ayodhya located on the banks of the Sarayu River in Uttar Pradesh, is one of the most sacred cities in India and holds immense religious and historical importance. It is widely revered as the birthplace of Lord Rama, the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu, and serves as a central setting in the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana. Historically known as Saketa, Ayodhya was the capital of the ancient Kosala kingdom and is recognized as one of the seven most sacred cities (Sapta Puri) in Hinduism. The city is home to the grand Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple, recently constructed at the site believed to be Lord Rama’s birthplace, attracting millions of devotees and tourists from around the world. Besides the Ram Temple, Ayodhya also features other spiritual landmarks such as Hanuman Garhi, Kanak Bhavan, and numerous ghats along the Sarayu River where pilgrims perform holy rituals.</p></div>

              <p><h3>Kedarnath Temple</h3>Kedarnath Temple, situated in the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand at an altitude of about 3,583 meters near the Mandakini River, is one of the most revered shrines of Lord Shiva. It is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas and forms a key part of the sacred Char Dham Yatra, along with Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Badrinath. According to Hindu mythology, the Pandavas from the Mahabharata sought Lord Shiva’s blessings here to atone for their sins after the Kurukshetra war. The temple is believed to have been revived by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century, although the site itself is much older. Architecturally, the temple is built from massive stone slabs in a traditional North Indian (Nagara) style, with a tall conical spire and a sanctum housing a naturally formed conical Shiva lingam believed to represent the hump of Lord Shiva’s bull form. Due to its high altitude, the temple remains open only from April/May to October/November each year, after which the idol is shifted to the Omkareshwar Temple in Ukhimath for winter worship.</p>
