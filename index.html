            <h3>AYODHYA TEMPLE</h3>
            <p>The legendary city of Ayodhya, popularly identified as the present-day Ayodhya, is identified in the epic Ramayana and its many versions as the birthplace of the Hindu deity Rama of Kosala and is hence regarded as the first of the seven most important pilgrimage sites for Hindus.[12][17] The Ayodhya dispute was centred on the Babri mosque, built 1528–29 under the Mughal emperor Babur and said to have been built on top of a Hindu temple that stood at the birth spot of Rama.[18] In 1992 a Hindu mob demolished the mosque, provoking riots throughout the country.[19] In 2019, the Supreme Court of India announced the final verdict that the land belonged to the government based on tax records;[20] It further ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Ram Mandir; which was consecrated in January 2024. It also ordered the government to give an alternate five acre tract of land to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to build the mosque.[21]</p>
